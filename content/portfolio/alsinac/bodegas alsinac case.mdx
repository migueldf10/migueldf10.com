With more than 45 years of experience in producing cava ( Spanish sparkling wine) Alsinac's brand already has a powerful base of happy customers. To expand further, from year 2013 on, they decided to start marketing their products directly to customers through their online site.

In our colaboration we revisited their online paid strategy. Setting up clear goals for every landing page and created an enviroment where you could measure success and failure with precission.

With these changes we wanted to improve more than a 30% Alsinac's return of investment on marketing expenses through Facebook Ads and Google Ads while giving their team freedom to develop new landing pages in a fraction of their previous time spend keeping aestethics and event tracking.

<TextBlock>
To measure the performance, we defined the add to cart as the key metric, and some side ones like time on page, contact, calls...

Then we designed and configured some reusable building blocks with different features and information which, combined them in different sets, composed landing pages. Depending on the combinations, you cover a certain set of pain points, tailormade for the audience you advertise to.

The ability to measure actions taken on each landing page and campaign, made possible to measure one against each other, adding or removing features to know what works best. 

As an example, you can know if assisting customers with a direct call button helped or not to sell more, or with a send a whatsapp button was best, depending on the campaign or audience.
