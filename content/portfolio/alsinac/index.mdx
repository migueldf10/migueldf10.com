With over 45 years of experience in producing cava ( Spanish sparkling wine) Alsinac's team know everything about their product. From year 2013 on, they became a DTC brand. Now they were looking for stepping up their online results.

The first steps were understanding and clearing out the purpose of each page, setting clear and measurable goals. In this case, orders per visitor.
Once this was clear, the other challenge left was to set up a system reusable and extendable for future marketing evolution.

The solution came out of creating different independant and reusable blocks with different purposes, to compose landing pages for different customers / campaigns, always keeping track of the primary goal ( Orders ) and secondary metrics, such as time on page, assisted conversions (via chat messages started)

To test this project, we composed different premade landings for their existing campaigns, testing the result against their existing pages.
