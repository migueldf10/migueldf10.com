In April I developed a custom app to test one concept.

Can you develop an application that growths exponentially, self sustains and has no marketing, almost no hosting expenses and no team backing it up?

We will see.

## What is exponential growth?

In times of coronavirus(\*1) everyone talks about the spread ratio. The amount N of people that get's contagiated after every new contagion. If N is bigger than 1, the growth is exponential, if not, well, not.

So what if there is a website where every time one person joins, causes more than one person joining? We would have a new FACEBOOK!!! Or a lighting of fame, like flappy bird would extremely fun and succesful too. And if not we would learn. So let's do it!

## Things it must have

The must haves for launch.

### Super low entry barrier.

If you want

\*1 yes, the idea came after seeing the 100th exponential graph about the pandemic spread model
